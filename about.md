About me:
I am a student of computer science. I enjoy science and technology. I have tried several things to date:
- Graphic Design
- Game Development
- Deep Learning

Lately, my interests have moved to Reinforcement Learning which I want to understand.

I was an intern at Citrix R&D, Banglore where I was part of the SD WAN team.
I have a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology and will be pursuing a Master's in Computer Science from Rochester Institute of Technology soon where I'll specialize in Intelligent Systems or Distributed Systems. Still have to decide!
